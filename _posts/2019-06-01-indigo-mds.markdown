The Mobility Data Specification (**MDS**), a project of the [Open Mobility Foundation](http://www.openmobilityfoundation.org) (OMF), is a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) focused on dockless e-scooters, bicycles, mopeds and carshare. Inspired by projects like [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/) and [GBFS](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs), the goals of MDS are to provide a standardized way for municipalities or other regulatory agencies to ingest, compare and analyze data from mobility service providers, and to give municipalities the ability to express regulation in machine-readable formats.

**MDS** helps cities interact with companies who operate dockless scooters, bicycles, mopeds and carshare in the public right-of-way. MDS is a key piece of digital infrastructure that supports the effective implementation of mobility policies in cities around the world.

**MDS** is an open-source project. It was originally created by the [Los Angeles Department of Transportation](http://ladot.io) (LADOT). In November 2019, stewardship of MDS and the ownership of this repository was transferred to the Open Mobility Foundation. GitHub automatically redirects any links to this repository in the `CityOfLosAngeles` organization to the `openmobilityfoundation` instead. MDS continues to be used by LADOT and many other municipalities.

Working with LADOT I helped launch the first implementation of MDS to manage the citywide eScooter and eBike program.  LADOT is now extending the use to taxis, car share and curb management.
