<p>I am a software product and engineering leader with a strong track record of successful startups (an IPO, two acquisitions and working on my fourth) with a focus on sustainability, energy and transportation. I love to build things that help people and planet. 

I helped start Lacuna with a mission to connect modern mobility to the public good by empowering cities with the open source software needed to create and manage equitable and sustainable transportation systems. I lead our Product team.
